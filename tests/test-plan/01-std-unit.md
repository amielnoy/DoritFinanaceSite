# STD-01 — Unit Tests

**Suite:** `unit` · **Runner:** `npm run test:unit` (Vitest) · **Location:** `tests/unit/`
**Cases:** 81 · **Environment:** node, except files ending `.dom.test.ts` (jsdom)

---

## 1. Purpose

Verify the repository's pure logic in isolation: the pension fee projection that
drives the site's headline calculator, the routing/class helpers, the
security-sensitive `?returnTo=` guard, and the contact configuration that four
different call-to-action shapes derive from.

## 2. Test items

| Item | Source |
|---|---|
| `computePensionFees`, `formatIls` | `src/lib/pension-fee.ts` |
| `createPageUrl` | `src/utils/index.ts` |
| `cn` | `src/lib/utils.js` |
| `safeReturnTo` | `src/lib/authReturnTo.js` |
| `CONTACT` | `src/config/contact.js` |

> **Note.** `computePensionFees` was extracted from `PensionFeeCalculator.tsx`
> during this work so the maths could be exercised without a DOM. The component
> now consumes it; behaviour is unchanged.

## 3. Approach

Deterministic, no I/O, no mocks. Financial figures are asserted both as exact
values where arithmetic is closed-form (total contributions, deposit fees) and
as invariants where it is iterative (balance > contributions, fees monotone in
the fee rate). Hostile input is exercised because every field is a free-text
`<input type=number>` a visitor can clear.

## 4. Test cases

### 4.1 Pension fee maths — `tests/unit/pension-fee.test.ts`

| ID | Title | Preconditions / input | Expected result |
|---|---|---|---|
| UNIT-PFC-001 | "returns the site's default scenario with coherent totals" | ₪2,000/mo, 2% deposit fee, 0.5% annual, 25 y, 5% return | `totalDeposited = 600,000`; `totalDepositFees ≈ 12,000`; `totalFees = deposit + annual`; `balance > totalDeposited`; `lostToFees > 0` |
| UNIT-PFC-002 | "is fee-free when both fee rates are zero" | Both fee rates 0 | All fee totals 0; `lostToFees ≈ 0` |
| UNIT-PFC-003 | "compounds nothing when the expected return is zero" | ₪1,000/mo, 10 y, 0% return, no fees | `balance ≈ 120,000` |
| UNIT-PFC-004 | "charges deposit fees exactly as a share of gross contributions" | 6% deposit fee | `totalDepositFees = totalDeposited × 0.06` |
| UNIT-PFC-005 | "monotonically shrinks the balance as fees rise" | Annual fee 0.1 / 0.5 / 1.5% | Balance strictly decreasing; `lostToFees` increasing |
| UNIT-PFC-006 | "grows the balance as the horizon lengthens" | 5 y vs 30 y | Longer horizon yields larger balance and contributions |
| UNIT-PFC-007 | "treats empty strings, junk and undefined as zero instead of NaN" | `""`, `"abc"` in every field | Every returned figure is finite and `0` |
| UNIT-PFC-008 | "accepts numeric strings from the `<input type=number>` fields" | All inputs as strings | Identical to the numeric-input result |
| UNIT-PFC-009 | "never produces negative or non-finite figures for negative years" | `years = -5` | Zero contributions and balance; finite `lostToFees` |
| UNIT-PFC-010 | "floors fractional years to whole months rather than looping oddly" | `years = 1.5` | 18 monthly contributions |
| UNIT-PFC-011 | "renders whole shekels with the ILS symbol" | `formatIls(1234.6)` | Contains `₪` and `1,235`; no decimal part |
| UNIT-PFC-012 | "survives NaN and undefined-ish values" | `formatIls(NaN)`, `formatIls(0)` | Returns a `₪` string, never throws |

### 4.2 Helpers — `tests/unit/utils.dom.test.ts`

| ID | Title | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| UNIT-UTL-001 | "prefixes a leading slash" | `createPageUrl("Home") === "/Home"` |
| UNIT-UTL-002 | "turns spaces into hyphens so page names stay URL-safe" | `"Blog Admin"` → `/Blog-Admin` |
| UNIT-UTL-003 | "handles the empty name without producing a double slash" | `""` → `/` |
| UNIT-UTL-004 | "joins conditional class names" | Falsy entries dropped |
| UNIT-UTL-005 | "lets the later Tailwind class win a conflict" | `cn("px-2","px-4") === "px-4"` |
| UNIT-UTL-006 | "returns an empty string for no input" | `cn() === ""` |

> jsdom is required only because `src/lib/utils.js` reads `window` at module
> scope (`isIframe`); see [10-known-issues](10-known-issues.md).

### 4.3 Open-redirect guard — `tests/unit/auth-return-to.dom.test.ts`

| ID | Title | Input | Expected result |
|---|---|---|---|
| UNIT-RET-001 | "defaults to / when no returnTo is present" | no query | `"/"` |
| UNIT-RET-002 | "keeps a plain same-origin path" | `/admin/leads` | `"/admin/leads"` |
| UNIT-RET-003 | "keeps normal app query params on the target path" | `/blog?page=2` | `"/blog?page=2"` |
| UNIT-RET-004 | "accepts an absolute same-origin URL and reduces it to a path" | `<origin>/claims` | `"/claims"` |
| UNIT-RET-005..012 | "rejects …" (8 cases) | `https://evil.com/`, `//evil.com`, `/\evil.com`, `/.//evil.com`, `\/evil.com`, `javascript:alert(1)`, `http://evil.com/steal`, `//evil.com/%2f..` | `"/"` for every one |
| UNIT-RET-013 | "never returns a value that could become protocol-relative" | all of the above | Result starts with exactly one `/`, contains no `\`, has no scheme |
| UNIT-RET-014..019 | "drops ?`<param>`=" (6 cases) | `access_token`, `clear_access_token`, `app_id`, `app_base_url`, `functions_version`, `from_url` | Param absent from the result |
| UNIT-RET-020 | "strips the bootstrap params but preserves the rest of the query" | `/oauth/consent?ctx=abc123&access_token=pwned` | `ctx` kept, `access_token` gone |

### 4.4 Contact configuration — `tests/unit/contact-config.test.ts`

| ID | Title | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| UNIT-CNT-001 | "exposes an E.164 dial number" | Matches `^\+972\d{9}$` |
| UNIT-CNT-002 | "exposes a wa.me number with no plus and no leading zero" | Matches `^972\d{9}$` |
| UNIT-CNT-003 | "keeps the wa.me number in sync with the dial number" | `whatsapp === phoneE164.replace("+","")` |
| UNIT-CNT-004 | "keeps the display number in sync with the dial number" | Digits of `phoneDisplay` reconstruct `phoneE164` |
| UNIT-CNT-005 | "exposes a valid contact email" | Matches an email shape |

### 4.5 Supabase auth adapter — `tests/unit/supabase-auth.test.ts`

`AuthPort` over Supabase. The semantics `AuthContext` depends on: the role comes
from `profiles` rather than the token, and failures carry the reason the context
distinguishes on.

| ID | Title | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| UNIT-SBA-001 | "reports the signed-in user with the role from profiles" | id, email, full_name, role |
| UNIT-SBA-002 | "reads the role from the table, never from the token" | A revoked role cannot survive in a stale JWT |
| UNIT-SBA-003 | "defaults a null role to user" | `role === "user"` |
| UNIT-SBA-004 | "asks for sign-in with the reason AuthContext looks for" | 403 + `auth_required` |
| UNIT-SBA-005 | "separates not-provisioned from not-signed-in" | 403 + `user_not_registered` |
| UNIT-SBA-006 | "sends the visitor to Google, returning where they started" | `signInWithOAuth` with `redirectTo` |
| UNIT-SBA-007 | "signs out before redirecting, not after" | `signOut` precedes navigation |
| UNIT-SBA-008 | "answers hasStoredToken synchronously" | Reflects the injected checker |
| UNIT-SBA-009 | "routes redirectToLogin through the same Google flow" | Both doors reach Google |
| UNIT-SBA-010 | "signs in with an address and a password" | Credentials forwarded verbatim |
| UNIT-SBA-011 | "throws on bad credentials, which Supabase reports without rejecting" | Rejects with the provider's message |
| UNIT-SBA-012 | "does not navigate: the caller owns the guarded destination" | Resolves without redirecting |

### 4.6 Store reconciliation — `tests/unit/reconcile.test.ts`

The gate phase 4 rests on: the flip is safe once the two stores have agreed for
a sustained stretch, and "agreed" has to be checkable. Exits non-zero on drift
so it can gate the cutover rather than merely describe it.

| ID | Title | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| UNIT-REC-001 | "is silent when they agree, despite blanks spelled differently" | `""` and NULL are not a disagreement |
| UNIT-REC-002 | "reports a lead the mirror never copied" | Listed as missing |
| UNIT-REC-003 | "reports a Supabase row with no counterpart" | Listed as orphaned |
| UNIT-REC-004 | "reports an update that reached only one store" | Listed as mismatched |
| UNIT-REC-005 | "names every field that differs, not just the first" | All differing fields |
| UNIT-REC-006 | "matches contacts on the phone number, however punctuated" | No false drift |
| UNIT-REC-007 | "compares a rating by value" | `5` equals `"5"` |
| UNIT-REC-008 | "compares published by truth, not spelling" | Real drift still caught |

## 5. Pass criteria

All 63 cases pass. Any failure is a functional defect, not an environment issue —
these tests have no external dependencies.
